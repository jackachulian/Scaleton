  title: The Finis Event
  lore:
  - In the darkness of the twenty-third century of the Old World, it was said by
    some that aboslution would be brought through a Time of Judgement.
  - The vast majority of Earth's populus wrote this off as the desperate prayers
    if the crazed, but certain powers took notice of this.
  - It is said that the first who were aware of this thoery were the luminaries of
    the Antediluvian Sacrosanct Agglomerate.
  - In order to progress their ascention plan, the ASA believed that this Time of
    Judgement must occur, and a new world must be erected upon the ruins of the old.
  - In year 2300 AD, this time of judgement finally occured.
  - Known as the Finis Event, it was caused by a CELL Technology weapons detonation
    by Leviathan leader Evan Levi that was set to destroy humanity on Earth.
  - Through the Finis Event, the past relics of humanity were ravenged and humanity
    was born anew as Manatians.
  - This information, however, has largely fallen out of public knowledge.
  - Few still know of the truth of this world's history, the death of the Old World.
