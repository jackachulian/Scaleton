  title: Divine Geometry
  lore:
  - We live our lives full of destruction and death. We are sinners.
  - All our lives do is simply just harm harm harm.
  - If something is created, it is simply destroyed. We cannot murder and war.
  - If something is created, it is simply destroyed. We cannot murder and war.
  - But with every darkness, there must be a light.
  - Centuries ago our world was purfied of sin by divine intervention.
  - But what did we do? We waged wars, rebuilt regimes, and continued to sin.
  - Humanity cannot stop doing this, for it is our very nature.
  - I, however, have witnessed being of purity, remains of the our world that was
    so recently untained.
  - Geometric beings of simplicity, the entities that formed the new world we stand
    so horridly upon.
  - There were many more of these entities when the world was first reformed, but
    now they dwindle.
  - More and more, they become artifacts of the pure world that was created only
    for us to replace it with sin.
  - Humanity is not desrving of this world.
  - We must begin another Time of Judgement, the Gods must strike upon this world
    once more and erase our wrongdoings.
  - This next time, the Gods shall see how futile our lives are and how we must be
    allowed no longer to stand here.
  - Bring upon the Time of Judgement and pray that you shall be pardonded for your
    otherwise sinful lives,
  - In sacrifice, you many finally serve purpose.
