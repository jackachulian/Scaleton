  title: Origins of the Labryinth of Binding
  lore:
  - The Labyrinth of Binding was initially used by a small post-Finis society.
  - Whether they built the labyrinth or simply found it is unknown.
  - Little is known about this early society, and they were quickly forgotten once
    conquered by the larger Bieace Empire.
  - Later sometime approximately around 530 RT, a plague broke out in the region
    and many traveled to the nearby Guardian Village for aid from the Razzion priesthood.
  - Too many were ill to fit in the village, however, and the labyrinth was used
    to house those who were struck.
  - Following the end of the plague, the labyrinth was used as a burial ground for
    some time, before eventually becoming largely abandonned.
  - Some of the Razzion priesthood found it disrespectful to fill the dark corridors
    of the mysterious structure with the bodies of the dead.
  - Recently, however, it was discovered that the labyrinths were the final resting
    grounds of the legendary hero Biphero.
  - Biphero was the weilder of the Holy Cards, a powerful artifact that had been
    passed down from generations and used to stop great evil.
  - To prevent this power from being abused, Biphero had secretly gone into self-isolation
    and hid himself, as well as his Holy Cards, in the third layer of the labyrinth
    at around 735 RT.
  - The Holy Cards were retrieved by the Biecean warrior Protipole, who fought Raidiole,
    a commander of the Bievil army, for the cards.
  - While most are purely interested in this battle or the cards themselves, I have
    found it facisnating that Protipole discovered that a woman named Eidola had
    begun living the the labyrinth.
  - Through some sort of necromantic magic, it appears she has revived many of the
    deceased in the structure to serve as her servants in a supposed empire she is
    starting.
  - I am yet to see this sight for myself, with the conclave suggesting I not interfere
    in the matters.
  - Nevertheless, this is a situation I watch with great intrigue.

    historian of the New World).
