  title: Alternate Timeline Theory
  lore:
  - 'There is a theory that our universe of made up of an infinite amount of parallel
    universes. '
  - At any moment, any action performed or not performed will cause one of these
    parallel universes to become an alternate universe.
  - It is also said that traveling to the past may cause an alternate universe of
    the past to exist at the same time.
  - Say you travel from year 700 to year 400. In the new universe, if it is 402,
    then the original is at year 702.
  - Travel between these two universes would be theoretically possible as long as
    you do not travel any futher into the past than the original travel, the timelines
    will exist simultaniously.
  - However, can we really call these "new" timelines? They already theoretically
    exist before you enter them.
  - '*The author is cited as "You can call me anything you want."*'
