  title: Summary of the Geofield Project
  lore:
  - The Geofield Project aims to develop a CELL-based barrier the protect the user
    from all incoming objects.
  - 'Geofield Local 1E-P.A: Failure to properly stop faster projectiles, Mana drain
    too powerful to sustain long-term. '
  - 'Geofield Local 1E-P.T: Fast projectiles are properly prevented, high mortality
    rate from CELL usage.'
  - 'Geofield Macro 1V-5.P: Requires 5 humans to power, protects a full room, 30
    minutes until mortality.'
  - 'Geofield Macro 1V-12.P: Requires 12 humans to power, protects a full room, 1.72x
    more efficient per human than 1V-5.P.'
  - 'Geofield Local 1E-B.T: Significantly reduced mortality rate from 1E-P.T,  less
    tolerence for higher velocities.'
  - 'Geofield Local 2E-M.V: Stronger barrier than 1E-B.T, increased energy efficiency.'
  - 'Geofield Local 2E-M.X: Removed weakness to lower-velocity projectiles, new issue
    of self-mutilation.'
  - 'Geofield Macro 2V-50.Z: Catastrophic failure led to destruction of facility.
    Macro development officially scapped in favor of Local.'
  - 'Geofield Local 2E-M.Z: Resolved self-mutilation issues, from 2E-M.X, increased
    tolerence to slower velocities.'
  - 'Geofield Local 3E-N.T: Increased efficiency and barrier range,'
  - Further documentation of restricted models can be accessed in the full report
    files.
