  title: What is CELL Tech?
  lore:
  - CELL Technology is something that has greatly improved the world we now live
    in.
  - Wars have ended and our nations are now united under eternal treaties.
  - But some of you may be wondering what this wonderful technology actually is.
  - CELL technology refers to devices that allow people to harness their inner Mana.
  - We all generate Mana, but we can't use it without CELL tech.
  - But with this great innovation, we are able to cast magic like the tales of old!
  - So much of our modern life uses magic-powered technology, such as your handheld
    devices;
  - CELL tech is called CELL because it is an extention of our true bodies, cells
    that connect us to our mana.
  - Sadly, however, we don't truly know the person behind the creation of the first
    CELL tech.
  - They are only known as "The Primogenitor," and were seemingly against their own
    invention.
  - -Cel Euler, UtiliArk spokesman (circa 22XX AD)
