  lore:
  - '*You can barely read out the text, it is hard to tell if what you are holding
    truly exists.*'
  - '[1278 AN]'
  - I have been following the hypothesis of the entity "Xuirer," which has led to
    great progress.
  - The power being brought out is something we should already be capable of, but
    have no means of harnessing naturally.
  - Like a Bipolian failing to ultize their Geom Energy, a Unique Spell is suposedly
    used naturally by others in a different world.
  - I don't trust "Xuirer" about his claims of being from an alternate world, but
    I will use him while he remains useful to this project.
  - Soon, the great powers thin will awaken, and no longer will Pepper's fruitless
    attempts to replicate the True Xuir be relevant.
  - The Shadow Realm shall be be, as it was meant to be.
  - I will take great pleasure at the extermination of the others in this lab, and
    perhaps Neville Prime himself.
