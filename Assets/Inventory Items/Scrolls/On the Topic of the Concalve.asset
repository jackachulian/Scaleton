  title: Fonding of the Conclave
  lore:
  - The Metalimnion Concalve is an organization that controls most travel between
    Metalimnions.
  - The Metalimnions were discovered shortly following the Finis Event, and are now
    used as a way of fast transportation.
  - The Metalimnions were initially freely open to all of the public, but the Realm
    War caused access to be restricted.
  - The Metalimnion Concalve now provide transportation for approved governmental
    members or certain elites.
  - Being out of the ruling of any empire, the Concalve is essentially one of the
    most powerful organizations in the world.
  - As the Concalve is the only means of travel between realms. all Empires respect
    the power of the Concalve and treat it as neutral grounds.
  - Due to the now closed nature of Metaliminal travel, an organization of mages
    known as the Siphon Cognoscenti formed.
  - The Cognoscenti provide commerial transportation via teleportation magic, but
    the maximum distance that can be traveled is much more limited and inter-realm
    travel is not possible.
